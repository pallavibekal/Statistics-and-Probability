It's core goal involves providing error control in the face of uncertainty. It was developed in the early 20-th century by Fisher, Neyman & Pearson, and others, largely replacing the present approaches to statistical inference, among them Bayesian inference.\n"

The amazing thing about this is that it applies to the sampling distributions of statistics that have been calculated from even highly non-normal distributions of data. Remember, also, that hypothesis testing is very much based on making inferences about such sample statistics.
